# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Simple game rock, paper, scissors game. This game can be played with two humans or with a Bot and a human.

The technologies used here-in are Java, JavaFX, Maven and CSS. Java, and javaFX were used to build this application to allow for practice developing both in java and making use of the javaFX GUI package. These technologies were of interest to me due to their use in imbedded systems. Whilst CSS was used to style various app components.
